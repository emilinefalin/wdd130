    <h2>Emiline Falin</h2>
    <p>Hello hello! I'm Emiline, and this is my first semester at BYU-Idaho! I'm attending most of my classes on campus, but I have this one online. I'm excited to be here with you all!</p>
    <p>I am a Business Managment major, but outside of that I love to draw, write, and watch Disney+. I'm also a huge nerd who loves to play video games, D&D, and create cosplays!</p>
    <p>I've lived here in Rexburg for a while now, but before that I lived in Virginia and England, both of which were a lot of fun. For now, though, I'm happy to be here in Idaho.</p>
