      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I am creating a personal website that will serve as an online portfolio. Since I’m an artist, the website will showcase my best artwork, as well as provide a way for people to get in contact with me. You’ve probably seen a lot of website templates like Wordpress and Squarespace, right? Well, instead of having to rely on the limitations of one of these services, my portfolio website will be fully customizable and adaptable, making it a better experience for both myself, and the people who will be viewing it.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience is intended to be potential employers, commissioners, and coworkers. Employers might be people who find me through LinkedIn, or my social media pages. They would be more professional-type people who are looking to hire illustrators and artists for part-time or full-time positions. Commissioners would be people looking to pay me for quick, one-time projects, and would tend to be a bit less formal. Coworkers would be people I’ve worked with before who are just interested in seeing my work. For all of these, the age range and income level can vary.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

      <h3>Portfolio</h3>
      <p>
        (Portfolio)
A collection of some of my best art pieces, and general examples of my work. Includes finished artwork, landscapes, sketches, graphic design work, and costume designs. For all areas of my skillset, I am capable of expanding, and experimenting with new styles and concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        (FINISHED ARTWORK)
My finished artwork is generally created with the drawing app Procreate. Pieces typically take between 1-5 hours to complete, depending on the complexity. I am experienced with drawing people, fantasy creatures, landscapes, and more.

(LANDSCAPES)
Landscape art is generally created with the drawing app Procreate, and pieces generally take 1-2 hours to complete. Inspiration is taken from both pop culture, and real life.

(SKETCHES)
Sketches are done on paper, in the drawing app Procreate, and in various other mediums. The time it takes to complete each sketch varies, but is generally much faster than finished artwork. 

(GRAPHIC DESIGN)
My graphic design work typically follows the process of: Brainstorming - Sketching ideas - Mock-ups - Final result. Below are examples of finished graphic design work, completed with various graphic softwares.

(COSTUME DESIGN)
I have created dozens of costumes over the past few years, and many of them were designed by me. Most of my costumes go through several design iterations before I am satisfied with the final result. Costumes are based on various costumes from pop culture, as well as my own imagination.

      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        (ABOUT)
Hello! I’m Emiline, going by the pseudonym ‘Winterstar Art’ on social media. I’m a multifaceted artist currently studying Illustration and Business Management at Brigham Young University, Idaho. 
I love delving into the realm of otherworldly fantasy with my artwork, creating characters and artwork from other worlds. A lot of my work is inspired by pop culture, and it was through this that I first started drawing.
Although I’ve had many different interests over the years, creative expression has been one that has stuck with me very firmly, and I’ve done a lot with it, including becoming proficient in areas such as digital art, graphic design, character design, landscape art, and, most recently, animation. I’m always striving to try out and learn new things, and find new ways to take my art and drawing skills to the next level.
In addition to being an artist, I'm also a writer, cosplayer, and entrepreneur. I created and am currently running two seperate businesses; one for my art, and one for my cosplays (costume design and creation). I'm always looking to learn new things, and use my talents to both help others, and support myself. I hope to one day turn my creative passions into a full-time career.
